# lorem-stuff
Lorem ipsum files for demonstrations (pdf, txt, images etc).

I usually use these files on live websites to showcase a funtionality or while developing. Simply said, I don't like using cats, birds and other funny things. Furthermore, I don't like using files from web search engines. Such things can remain on the server(s) by mistake and this is bad business.

## Files included
- *.pdf (empty)
- *.txt (empty)
- *.png (several png images)
- pointer.gif
- favicon.ico (white)
- index.html (with the "It Works" message)


## Usage
- Showcase and demonstration (if you want to avoid cats and funny images!)
- Testing with real files (eg test an upload input)
- Use as default files for projects (eg when users do not upload a file)
